JIP-API reference documentation
===============================

The JIP platform is mostly written in Python, except for the stream dispatcher, which is written in C and integrated as a Python Extension. This documentation covers the JIP API and describes the basic modules and classes that make up the system. 

In a lot of cases it will not be neccessary to read and undestand the full API reference. It might come in handy though when you are in the situation of extending the system, for example, adding support for your own cluster, or if you want to digg deeper and see how things are created.
